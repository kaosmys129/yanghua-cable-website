          "body": "In high-rise buildings, underground railways, underground streets, important industrial and mining enterprises, and large power stations, fire-resistant cables are widely used. These places are closely related to fire safety and firefighting rescue. In buildings, transportation, petrochemicals, ships, subways, nuclear power plants, and other locations, the use of fire-resistant cables can improve the safety and reliability of electrical systems, protect people's lives and property safety, and reduce the impact of fire accidents on society. The need for fire-resistant cables is mainly to respond to emergencies such as fires. When a fire occurs, flames may ignite insulation and sheath materials in wires and cables, causing fire accidents to further expand. Therefore, fire-resistant cables must be used in power and control circuits for firefighting equipment and emergency guide lights and other emergency facilities. Fire-resistant cables can maintain safe operation for a certain period during fires, thus playing an important role in power and signal transmission and distribution. They are also important components of fire protection systems, smoke prevention, alarm systems, and evacuation systems. In addition, fire-resistant cables have a longer service life, do not release any toxic chemicals during combustion, can prevent the formation of 'fire' signals, provide safety, and prevent other alarms from opening or failing in a short time. For more information about fire-resistant cables, please read the 'Fire-Resistant Cable Design and Procurement Manual.'

In January 2022, the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments issued policies proposing that by the end of the '14th Five-Year Plan,' the country should form a moderately advanced, balanced layout, intelligent and efficient charging infrastructure system capable of meeting the charging needs of more than 20 million electric vehicles. The introduction of multiple policies has driven rapid development in the domestic charging pile industry.\n\n**Shenzhen - Super Charging City Construction**\n\nOn November 30, a mobilization and deployment meeting for Shenzhen's super charging city construction was held. Mayor Qin Weizhong attended the event and delivered a mobilization speech. The meeting pointed out the need to treat building a high-quality charging infrastructure system as important work, accelerate the construction of a world-class super charging city, create a global digital energy pioneer city, better support high-quality development of the new energy industry, promote green transformation of economic and social development, and help achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals.\n\nIncluding the Futian Inli Super Charging Station, Shenzhen has currently built 41 new energy vehicle super charging stations. Shenzhen's future goal is: by 2025, build 300 super charging stations, with the 'super charging/refueling' ratio reaching 1:1 first in the country; by 2035, over 2,000 super charging stations, achieving charging piles wherever there are roads.\n\n**Continuous Technological Innovation**"

According to reports, Huawei's liquid-cooled super charging terminal has a maximum output power of 600kW. High-power fast charging and even super charging will be a major trend in charging technology in the future.\n\nHigh-power fast charging brings greater challenges to the power grid. First, charging equipment may cause power quality problems. Second, due to the uncertainty and randomness of new energy vehicle user charging, when a large number of new energy vehicles charge during peak electricity consumption periods, it will further increase the operational burden on the power system. As the number of new energy vehicles increases, their electricity consumption growth will follow, and the contradiction between high-power fast charging pile construction and power systems will intensify.\n\n**High-Current Flexible Busbar**\n\n**High-Current Power Supply and Distribution**"

The product structure mainly consists of flexible copper wire strip conductors, wrapping layers, insulation layers, interlocking metal armor layers, and sheath layers.\n\nFlexible busbar products have seven major highlights: high protection level, compact structure, high power efficiency, high reliability, high safety, low cost, and intelligence.\n\n**Flexible Busbar Applications**\n\n**Shenzhen Futian Inli Super Charging Station**\n\nCurrently, high-current flexible busbar products have been successfully applied in the demonstration of Shenzhen Futian Inli Super Charging Station's '600kW' taxi super charging station. High-current flexible busbars can provide power to Huawei super charging hosts more efficiently, quickly, and safely. This super charging station can achieve 'one cup of coffee, full charge and go,' providing new energy vehicle owners with more convenient and fast charging experiences while greatly improving the stability and efficiency of super charging stations. This project has completed power-on acceptance for over two months and is operating well."
