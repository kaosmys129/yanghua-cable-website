    "content": "**Why do multiple parallel cables always have one heating up first?**\n\n![Current Deviation Illustration](http://yanghuasti.jx5.szbdk.cn/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715242653421775624089.png)\n\nIn electrical systems operation, current deviation or shunting in multiple parallel cables is common. During parallel installation, the actual current capacity is not a simple '1+1=2' relationship. **Very likely '1+1=1.5' or even '1+1=1' phenomena may occur!**\n\n### What is Cable Current Deviation?\n\n![Current Distribution](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715298284674518109911.png)\n\nIdeally, current in each conductor should be evenly distributed. However, reality shows uneven distribution, causing cable current deviation.\n\n### Causes of Current Deviation:\n\n1. **Three-phase load imbalance** - Important factor\n2. **Harmonic interference** - Cannot be ignored  \n3. **Line faults** - Contributing factor\n4. **Installation issues**:\n   - Loose copper lug compression\n   - Poor contact surface connections\n   - Oxidation and dirt affecting contact resistance\n\n![Installation Issues](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715333385043201677435.jpg)\n\n### Consequences:\n- Conductors with high current experience abnormal heating\n- Accelerated insulation material aging\n- Declined insulation performance\n- Safety risks: leakage, short circuits, fires\n\n### Flexible Busbar Solution:\n\n![Flexible Busbar Display](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715357870363588010081.jpg)\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- Large single conductor current capacity (200-6300A)\n- Reduces or eliminates need for multiple parallels\n- Simple drilling connection method\n- No copper lug installation required\n- Reduces installation costs and complexity\n\n![Project Application](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715360691874756187723.png)\n\nMany newly built commercial buildings and industrial plants have adopted high-current flexible busbars with excellent operational results, greatly improving electrical system safety and stability.",
