Over 80% of workshop main cables use 4-8 parallel designs, with some old plants even showing extreme cases of 10 parallel cables.\n\n![Multiple Cable Installation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946930937832503301686.jpg)\n\nThis 'quantity stacking' approach essentially uses simple addition to address complex needs, laying hidden dangers for safety.\n\n![Chemical Plant Environment](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946931966107413793583.jpg)\n\nWhat do chemical plant power systems fear? Besides high current, invisible water vapor and dust are 'invisible killers'!\n\n![Industrial Power Distribution](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946934226416318418939.jpg)\n\nDue to limited single cable current capacity, multiple parallel connections (i.e., 'multiple parallels') are needed to increase load capacity. However, multiple parallel cables present the following problems:\n\n① Uneven current distribution, with some cables facing dramatically increased overload risks.\n\n![Current Distribution Issues](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946935573979547567196.jpg)\n\n② Multiple parallel cables lead to tight installation space and reduced heat dissipation efficiency.\n\n![Heat Dissipation Problems](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946937228518029483016.jpg)\n\n③ Doubled number of connections, more troublesome installation, increased failure points (each additional parallel increases connection hazards by over 30%). For example, when workshops need to carry currents above 1600A, at least 6 parallel 185mm² cables are required.\n\n![Multiple Connection Points](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946938382538704488942.jpg)\n\n④ Steam, acid-alkali dust, equipment vibration, high temperature, and other environmental factors in chemical plants will infinitely amplify the defects of multiple parallel cables, making later troubleshooting and maintenance difficult for multiple parallel cables.\n\n![Environmental Challenges](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946939878915711447867.jpg)\n\nFlexible busbars easily solve these problems~\n\n**Highlight 1:** High-current flexible busbars have large single conductor current capacity, greatly reducing the number of parallels needed while being able to run long distances, meeting IP68 high standards, suitable for both indoor and outdoor installation.\n\n![Flexible Busbar Installation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946942521302886142731.png)\n\n**Highlight 2:** Greatly reduced number of connections! High flexibility allows direct bending within bending radius without needing turning connections; no intermediate connections needed for long-distance installation, preventing water vapor and various dusts from penetrating, more secure!\n\n![Flexible Installation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946943436682204780149.png)\n\n**Highlight 3:** Small size, light weight, convenient installation and connection! Connection with copper bars only requires drilling, installation can go through cable trays, conduits, trenches, etc.\n\n![Easy Installation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250730/6388946944228143447430955.png)"

      "content": "**Why do multiple parallel cables always have one heating up first?**\n\n![Current Inequality Illustration](http://yanghuasti.jx5.szbdk.cn/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715242653421775624089.png)\n\nIn the actual operation of electrical systems, have you encountered situations where multiple parallel cables have current deviation or shunting?\n\n![Cable Current Distribution](http://yanghuasti.jx5.szbdk.cn/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715250475370847665699.png)\n\nDuring parallel installation of cables, the actual current capacity is not a simple '1+1=2' relationship. **Very likely '1+1=1.5' or even '1+1=1' phenomena may occur!**\n\n![Parallel Cable Issues](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715290784623529022834.jpg)\n\n**What exactly is cable current deviation?**\n\nIn scenarios where multiple cables are used in parallel, ideally, the current in each conductor should be evenly distributed.\n\n![Ideal Current Distribution](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715298284674518109911.png)\n\nHowever, reality is often not the case. If current distribution among conductors becomes uneven, cable current deviation occurs.\n\n![Current Deviation Reality](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715302508251049106387.png)\n\n**What causes multiple parallel cable current deviation or shunting?**\n\nCable current deviation is usually caused by multiple factors: ① Three-phase load imbalance is an important reason. ② Harmonic interference cannot be ignored. ③ Line faults are also factors leading to cable current deviation.\n\n![Deviation Causes](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715316966132061970060.jpg)\n\nEspecially noteworthy is that multiple parallel cables present numerous troubles during installation.\n\n- If copper lugs are not properly made, such as loose compression of copper lugs, this will not only affect normal cable operation but may also further exacerbate current deviation.\n\n![Copper Lug Connection Issues](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715333385043201677435.jpg)\n\n- Or if contact surfaces are not properly connected, with oxidation, dirt, and other conditions, contact resistance will change, causing uneven current distribution.\n\n![Contact Surface Problems](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715336638225561838498.png)\n\nThe consequences of current deviation are very serious. Conductors with high current will experience abnormal heating, and conductor heating will accelerate insulation material aging. After insulation aging, its insulation performance will decline, easily causing safety accidents such as leakage, and may even cause short circuits and fires.\n\n![Safety Consequences](http://yanghuasti.jx5.szbdk.cn/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715340427526513796717.jpg)\n\nMoreover, **the more complex the situation with high current, dense wiring, and parallel cables**, the more attention current deviation problems require.\n\n![Complex Installation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715354560272396719951.jpg)\n\n**How to reduce the probability of current deviation?**\n\nTo effectively reduce the probability of cable current deviation, **high-current flexible busbars are a good solution.**\n\n![Flexible Busbar Solution](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715357870363588010081.jpg)\n\nHigh-current flexible busbars have large single conductor current capacity, covering 200-6300A.\n\n![High Current Capacity](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715360691874756187723.png)\n\nThis characteristic allows them to reduce the number of parallels needed to meet the same power requirements, or even eliminate the need for multiple parallels. Compared to multiple parallel cables, this reduces installation complexity and potential problems.\n\n![Simplified Installation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715374175188373702659.jpg)\n\nMoreover, the connection method for high-current flexible busbars is more convenient, allowing direct drilling for connections without installing copper lugs.\n\n![Easy Connection Method](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715395225047775231145.jpg)\n\nThis not only reduces installation costs and difficulty but also greatly reduces the possibility of current deviation caused by improper copper lug installation or poor contact surface connections.\n\n![Improved Reliability](http://yanghuasti.jx5.szbdk.cn/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715384371320695384422.jpg)\n\nMany newly built commercial buildings and industrial plants have adopted high-current flexible busbars in their power distribution systems, with good operational results, greatly improving the safety and stability of electrical systems.\n\n![Successful Applications](http://yanghuasti.jx5.szbdk.cn/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250703/6388715386963543264936126.jpg)\n\nIf you are interested in electrical knowledge or want to learn more about cable operation and electrical safety, welcome to follow us.

      "content": "**Supporting Xinjiang's 'Belt and Road' Construction, Flexible Busbars Always on the Road**\n\nXinjiang, known as the 'Golden Corridor' open to innovation and connectivity, is located in the center of the Eurasian continent and is an important node of the ancient Silk Road. With the deepening of the 'Belt and Road' initiative and Western Development, the gradual improvement of transportation hubs, Xinjiang's trade exchanges with various countries have become increasingly close, and the role of the 'Golden Corridor' has become more prominent. According to incomplete statistics, as of November 2024, Xinjiang's total foreign trade import and export value exceeded 400 billion yuan, with growth rates ranking first in the country.\n\n![Xinjiang Trade Growth](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250103/6387151135772742497717749.png)\n\nFor the 'Belt and Road' and Western Development, Yanghua Technology has always maintained high attention and full participation, from project implementation to investment and factory construction, flexible busbars have always been at the 'forefront.'\n\n![Belt and Road Development](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250103/6387151138338219721812496.jpg)\n\nOn December 23, Xu Feng, Party Group Member and Deputy Mayor of Alashankou City People's Government, led a team to visit Yanghua Technology to investigate flexible busbars. Yanghua Technology Chairman Zhang Haidong explained in detail the advantages and applications of flexible busbars, and both sides conducted in-depth discussions about future cooperation. As of November this year, Xinjiang Free Trade Zone's import and export reached 162.92 billion yuan, accounting for over 40%, with Alashankou Comprehensive Bonded Zone and the other three comprehensive bonded zones showing year-on-year import and export growth exceeding 21%.\n\n![Government Visit](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250103/6387151141742754721944546.jpg)\n\nAlashankou City leadership team expressed that whether for import and export trade or local energy-related infrastructure, power systems are a very important sector, and flexible busbars will definitely shine on the local high-current power transmission and distribution stage.\n\n![Industry Discussion](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250103/6387151144815512455393585.jpg)\n\nIn addition to inviting relevant teams from various regions in Xinjiang to visit the company and exhibition hall for technical exchanges, Yanghua Technology also actively participates in the exchange and development between 'Shenzhen and Xinjiang.' On December 26, the company was invited to participate in the 'Shenzhen-Xinjiang Linkage, Belt and Road New Chapter' investment promotion conference. This conference was hosted by the national-level Wujiaqu Economic and Technological Development Zone, aiming to establish trade ties between Xinjiang's 'Belt and Road' and excellent enterprises in the Bay Area. Wujiaqu has rich mineral resources and solid industrial foundation, such as domestic agricultural machinery manufacturing base, steel production and processing base, and various chemical parks.\n\n![Conference Scene](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250103/66d795d3-5085-49da-8da6-47e0a79f991f.jpg)\n\nFor high-current power transmission and distribution needs, Wujiaqu needs and hopes to have innovative, cutting-edge, high-quality solutions that can solve power transmission and distribution needs while optimizing power energy structure and driving local related industrial chain development.\n\n![Development Vision](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/20250103/6387151149951344417568988.png)\n\nWhether it's Wujiaqu Economic and Technological Development Zone or Alashankou City, Yanghua Technology actively responds and promotes the practice and application of flexible busbars in Xinjiang and even the western regions. In low-voltage high-current power transmission and distribution scenarios, we firmly believe that flexible busbars will leverage product advantages to contribute to national 'Belt and Road' construction and Xinjiang's energy and industrial development."

These places are closely related to fire safety and firefighting rescue. In buildings, transportation, petrochemicals, ships, subways, nuclear power plants, and other locations, the use of fire-resistant cables can improve the safety and reliability of electrical systems, protect people's lives and property safety, and reduce the impact of fire accidents on society. The need for fire-resistant cables is mainly to respond to emergencies such as fires. When a fire occurs, flames may ignite insulation and sheath materials in wires and cables, causing fire accidents to further expand. Therefore, fire-resistant cables must be used in power and control circuits for firefighting equipment and emergency guide lights and other emergency facilities. Fire-resistant cables can maintain safe operation for a certain period during fires, thus playing an important role in power and signal transmission and distribution. They are also important components of fire protection systems, smoke prevention, alarm systems, and evacuation systems. In addition, fire-resistant cables have a longer service life, do not release any toxic chemicals during combustion, can prevent the formation of 'fire' signals, provide safety, and prevent other alarms from opening or failing in a short time. For more information about fire-resistant cables, please read the 'Fire-Resistant Cable Design and Procurement Manual.'

Their function is similar to gas pumps at gas stations. They can be fixed on the ground or walls, installed in public buildings (public buildings, shopping malls, public parking lots, etc.) and residential community parking lots or charging stations, and can charge various types of electric vehicles according to different voltage levels.\n\n**Charging Pile Classification**\n\n![Charging Pile Types](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E5%85%85%E7%94%B5%E6%A1%A9%E5%88%86%E7%B1%BB.jpg)\n\nAccording to different charging methods, service objects, installation methods, and charging interfaces, charging piles can be classified into: DC/AC charging piles, public/private charging piles, floor-standing/wall-mounted charging piles, single-pile single-charge/single-pile multiple-charge, etc.\n\n**AC Slow Charging vs DC Fast Charging**\n\n![AC vs DC Comparison](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E5%AF%B9%E6%AF%94.jpg)\n\nAccording to output current methods, they can be divided into AC charging piles and DC charging piles.\n\nAC charging piles are widely used in both public and private charging. AC charging piles are specialized power supply devices that provide AC power for electric vehicles with onboard charging devices. AC charging piles have small charging current and long charging time, suitable for slow charging in residential areas and office building parking spaces.\n\n![DC Charging Pile](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E7%9B%B4%E6%B5%81%E5%85%85%E7%94%B5%E6%A1%A9.jpg)\n\nDC charging piles are mainly used for public charging. DC charging piles are specialized devices that convert AC power to DC power for charging electric vehicle power batteries. DC charging piles have large charging current and short charging time, suitable for public places requiring fast charging.\n\n**Future Development Prospects of Charging Piles**\n\n![EV Market Growth](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E5%85%85%E7%94%B5%E8%BD%A6.jpg)\n\nIn the future, charging infrastructure will depend on collaborative support from big data, 5G, and other new technologies and fields. It is expected that after 2025, as the competitiveness of new energy vehicles gradually surpasses fuel vehicles, the charging infrastructure market will enter maturity, with a vehicle-to-pile ratio reaching 2:1, and the industry may achieve large-scale profitability.\n\n**Policy Interpretation**\n\n![Policy Framework](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E8%A7%A3%E8%AF%BB.jpg)\n\nIn 2020, the government work report included charging piles in the seven key areas of 'new infrastructure,' marking a further increase in national emphasis on charging infrastructure construction. In January 2022, the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments issued policies proposing that by the end of the '14th Five-Year Plan,' the country should form a moderately advanced, balanced layout, intelligent and efficient charging infrastructure system capable of meeting the charging needs of more than 20 million electric vehicles. The introduction of multiple policies has driven rapid development in the domestic charging pile industry.\n\n**Shenzhen - Super Charging City Construction**\n\nOn November 30, a mobilization and deployment meeting for Shenzhen's super charging city construction was held. Mayor Qin Weizhong attended the event and delivered a mobilization speech. The meeting pointed out the need to treat building a high-quality charging infrastructure system as important work, accelerate the construction of a world-class super charging city, create a global digital energy pioneer city, better support high-quality development of the new energy industry, promote green transformation of economic and social development, and help achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals.\n\nIncluding the Futian Inli Super Charging Station, Shenzhen has currently built 41 new energy vehicle super charging stations. Shenzhen's future goal is: by 2025, build 300 super charging stations, with the 'super charging/refueling' ratio reaching 1:1 first in the country; by 2035, over 2,000 super charging stations, achieving charging piles wherever there are roads.\n\n**Continuous Technological Innovation**\n\n![Technology Innovation](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0.jpg)\n\nRecently, Huawei's fully liquid-cooled super charging technology has begun nationwide deployment. According to reports, Huawei's liquid-cooled super charging terminal has a maximum output power of 600kW. High-power fast charging and even super charging will be a major trend in charging technology in the future.\n\nHigh-power fast charging brings greater challenges to the power grid. First, charging equipment may cause power quality problems. Second, due to the uncertainty and randomness of new energy vehicle user charging, when a large number of new energy vehicles charge during peak electricity consumption periods, it will further increase the operational burden on the power system. As the number of new energy vehicles increases, their electricity consumption growth will follow, and the contradiction between high-power fast charging pile construction and power systems will intensify.\n\n**High-Current Flexible Busbar**\n\n**High-Current Power Supply and Distribution**\n\n![High Current Distribution](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E5%A4%A7%E7%94%B5%E6%B5%81%E4%BE%9B%E9%85%8D%E7%94%B5.jpg)\n\nCurrently, although DC charging piles solve the problem of excessive charging time for AC charging piles, they also place higher requirements on the safety of power supply and equipment. Charging piles consist of charging equipment, power distribution equipment, and management equipment. On the power distribution side, with the construction and upgrading of high-power super charging stations, safe, efficient, and stable high-current power supply and distribution products are particularly important.\n\n**High-Current Flexible Busbar**\n\n![Flexible Busbar Product](http://www.yanghuasti.com/Data/yanghuasti/upload/image/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E5%A4%A7%E7%94%B5%E6%B5%81%E6%9F%94%E6%80%A7%E6%AF%8D%E7%BA%BF-4.jpg)\n\nAs an innovative application product for high-current power supply and distribution, the high-current flexible insulated busbar (abbreviated: flexible busbar) is a type of flexible insulated bus conductor made of copper wire strips as conductors using partial cable technology. The product structure mainly consists of flexible copper wire strip conductors, wrapping layers, insulation layers, interlocking metal armor layers, and sheath layers.\n\nFlexible busbar products have seven major highlights: high protection level, compact structure, high power efficiency, high reliability, high safety, low cost, and intelligence.\n\n**Flexible Busbar Applications**\n\n**Shenzhen Futian Inli Super Charging Station**\n\nCurrently, high-current flexible busbar products have been successfully applied in the demonstration of Shenzhen Futian Inli Super Charging Station's '600kW' taxi super charging station. High-current flexible busbars can provide power to Huawei super charging hosts more efficiently, quickly, and safely. This super charging station can achieve 'one cup of coffee, full charge and go,' providing new energy vehicle owners with more convenient and fast charging experiences while greatly improving the stability and efficiency of super charging stations. This project has completed power-on acceptance for over two months and is operating well."
