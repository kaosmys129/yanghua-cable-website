"Content: Readability Difficult","Opportunity","Low","2","7.140","Copy on the page is difficult to read and best understood by college graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"Response Codes: Internal Client Error (4xx)","Issue","High","6","3.450","Internal URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as a 404 or 410 should be updated to their correct locations, removed and redirected where appropriate. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent' and crawling again.",""
"H1: Over 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","1","3.570","Pages which have <h1>s over the configured length. There is no hard limit for characters in an <h1>, however they should be clear and concise for users and long headings might be less helpful","Write concise <h1>s for users, including target keywords where natural for users - without keyword stuffing.",""
"Images: Missing Size Attributes","Opportunity","Low","85","85.000","Image elements without dimensions (width and height size attributes) specified in the HTML. This can cause large layout shifts as the page loads and be frustrating experience for users. It is one of the major reasons that contributes to a high Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).","Define all image sizes as their native size using width and height attributes in the HTML. This allows the browser to calculate enough space for each image before it loads, avoiding large layout shifts.",""
"Hreflang: Non-200 hreflang URLs","Issue","High","3","10.710","URLs contained within rel=""alternate"" hreflang annotations that do not have a 200 response code, such as URLs blocked by robots.txt, no responses, 3XX (redirects), 4XX (client errors) or 5XX (server errors). Hreflang URLs must be crawlable and indexable and therefore non-200 URLs are treated as errors, and ignored by the search engines. The non-200 hreflang URLs can be seen in the lower window 'URL Details' pane with a 'non-200' confirmation status. They can be exported in bulk via the 'Reports > Hreflang > Non-200 Hreflang URLs' export.","Ensure URLs within hreflang annotations are to the correct canonical and indexable pages. If Google can't see pages pointing to each other due to a non-200 response, the tags will be ignored.",""
"Canonicals: Non-Indexable Canonical","Issue","High","3","10.710","Pages with a canonical URL that is non-indexable. This will include canonicals which are blocked by robots.txt, no response, redirect (3XX), client error (4XX), server error (5XX), are 'noindex' or 'canonicalised' themselves. This means the search engines are being instructed to consolidate indexing and link signals to a non-indexable page, which often leads to them ignoring the canonical, but may also lead to unpredictability in indexing and ranking. Export pages, their canonicals and status codes via 'Reports > Canonicals > Non-Indexable Canonicals'.","Ensure canonical URLs are to accurate indexable pages to avoid them being ignored by search engines, and any potential indexing or ranking unpredictability.",""
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","2","7.140","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure. However, this filter can help you quickly scan to review if they are used appropriately.","Ensure <h2>s are used in a logical hierarchical heading structure, and update where appropriate utilising the full heading rank between (h3 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Response Codes: Internal Redirection (3xx)","Warning","Low","3","1.720","Internal URLs which redirect to another URL. These will include server-side redirects, such as 301 or 302 redirects (and more). View URLs that link to redirects using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Redirection (3xx) inlinks'.","Ideally all internal links would be to canonical resolving URLs, and avoid linking to URLs that redirect. This reduces latency of redirect hops for users, and enhanced efficiency for search engines.",""
"Content: Readability Very Difficult","Opportunity","Low","3","10.710","Copy on the page is very difficult to read and best understood by university graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"Hreflang: Multiple Entries","Issue","High","28","100.000","URLs with multiple entries to a language or regional code. For example, if page X links to page Y and Z using the same 'en' hreflang value annotation. This filter will also pick up multiple implementations, for example, if hreflang annotations were discovered as link elements and via HTTP header.","Update hreflang annotations to only use a language and region pair once, so they can be used for geotargeting the right audiences appropriately.",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","3","10.710","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Hreflang: Not Using Canonical","Issue","High","22","78.570","URLs not using the canonical URL on the page in its own hreflang annotation. Hreflang should only include canonical versions of URLs.","Update hreflang annotations to include canonical versions of URLs only. They should not include links which are canonicalised to other URLs.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","2","7.140","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Hreflang: Inconsistent Language & Region Return Links","Issue","High","3","10.710","URLs with inconsistent language and regional return links to them. This is where a return link has a different language or regional value than the URL is referencing itself. The inconsistent language return URLs can be seen in the lower window 'URL Details' pane with an 'Inconsistent' confirmation status. They can be exported in bulk via the 'Reports > Hreflang > Inconsistent Language Return Links' export.","Ensure alternate pages include the same language and regional values in its hreflang annotation return links as the page declares within its own.",""
"H2: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","2","7.140","Pages with an <h2> that is not the second heading level after the <h1> on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h2> is the second heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the heading element following an <h1> should be an <h2>, rather than an <h3>.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","3","10.710","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Canonicals: Canonicalised","Warning","High","22","78.570","Pages that have a canonical to a different URL. The URL is 'canonicalised' to another location. This means the search engines are being instructed to not index the page, and the indexing and linking properties should be consolidated to the URL in the canonical.","These URLs should be reviewed carefully to ensure the indexing and link signals are being consolidated to the correct URL. In a perfect world, a website wouldn't need to canonicalise any URLs as only canonical versions would be linked to internally on a website, but often they are required due to various circumstances outside of control, and to prevent duplicate content. Update internal links to canonical versions of URLs where possible.",""
"Images: Over 100 KB","Opportunity","Medium","27","27.000","Large images over a size threshold. Page speed is extremely important for users and SEO and often large resources such as images are one of the most common issues that slow down web pages. This filter simply acts as a general rule of thumb to help identify images that are fairly large in file size and may take longer to load. These should be considered for optimisation, alongside opportunities identified in the PageSpeed tab which uses the PSI API and Lighthouse to audit speed. This can help identify images that haven't been optimised in size, load offscreen, are unoptimised etc.","Uncompressed images bloat pages with unnecessary bytes, so ensure images are optimised with compression, properly scaled, and using the best image format to reduce file size where possible.",""
"Page Titles: Below 30 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","1","3.570","Pages which have page titles under the configured limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs.",""
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","2","7.140","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
